---

Published on March 23, 2023

## Introduction

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive web development.Its goal is to help you build scalable and maintainable applications with as little custom code as possible. The framework contains a number of easy-to-use and beneficial features, such as modular build tooling, browser compatibility flags, Sass support, and prebuilt mixins.
I'll demonstrate you the basics of getting started with Tailwind CSS for your upcoming project in this article!

## Prerequisite Knowledge

To follow this you should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

## Software Requirements

You need only 2 things. First one is a web browser, you can use Google Chrome, Edge, Firefox or any other browser. Second one is a code editor, you can use VSCode, Sublime text, Atom or any other as well. For this guide I have used VSCode as it supports a few extenstions that will make the progress easier. The extensions used here are :

1. [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)
2. [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
3. [PostCSS Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss)

## Getting Started

Tailwind CSS can be installed using multiple methods such as:

1. Using Tailwind CLI
2. Using PostCSS
3. Using Framework Guides
4. Using Play CDN

In this guide you will learn how to install it using Tailwind CLI.  For that the very first step is to create a folder, you can name it whatever you want. For this guide the name of folder is `tailwindCSS`.
After you have succesfully created an empty folder, open the folder in your code editor( This guide used VSCode as specified in the Software Requirements section).  
Now create a new HTML file Again, you can name it whatever you want. For this guide the name of folder is `index.html`. You only need a simple HTML document, an example of that is given below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Tailwind Guide</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Right click on the HTML Document and Click on `Open With Live Server`. This will open the document on your default browser.

After clicking on live server the document will be displayed. If you used the same HTML code specified above, it will look like this :

## Install Tailwind

Before you begin to install Tailwind, you have to open the Terminal in the `tailwindCSS` folder. If you are using VSCode use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + '`, and then the terminal will appear at the bottom. You IDE will look like this:
![image4](\img\docs\webDevelopment\tailwind-installation-guide\4.png)

You have to initialize the application by entering the command. This command will create a `package.json` file.

```shell
npm init -y
```

Your directory will have 2 files.

### Install Using npm

Now you are all set to install Tailwind. To install Tailwind CSS through npm, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss
```

The next step is to initialize tailwind in your application, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init
```

After you run these two commands, a new file named `tailwind.config.js` is produced in your folder( plus some other files, which are create by npm ).

### Configure the template paths

Your template paths are configured in the `tailwind.config.js` file. Let's understand this statement.
Template file is your HTML or Javascript file in which you will add tailwind classes. Configuring the paths mean that the paths to these files(templates) are added in the `content` section in the `tailwind.config.js` file. So add the following lines in the `content` section:

```javascript
content: [
 "./intex.html",
 "./src/**/*.{html,js}",
]
```

### Add Tailwind Directives to CSS

For this step, you have to create a `src` folder(inside the root folder) and add CSS file in it.  You can name it whatever you want. For this guide the name of file is `index.css`.
After the file is created, add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS file. This simply means adding the following lines of code:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

These three are called directives/functions and are owned by Tailwind CSS, which is written based on PostCSS. So this is not ordinary CSS, so later before running, tailwind will first pass through this css file, and once it passes through this css file, it will run these 3 layers of tailwind, before later a new css file will be created, which is the file used by our web browser (compiled).

### Start Tailwind CLI build process

To run the build process, create final CSS file that will be used by your website. For that, execute the following command:

```shell
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```

Let us understand this command. This command will run the execution of the Tailwind application with the input file, which is written after `i` flag, `index.css`. CSS then produces the output file, `output.css`.  `--watch` means is that every change will be known by tailwind, so that whatever you do in your html file will be processed immediately. That's because the tailwind feature is called the Just-in-Time engine. Later, the process will continue till it is turned off.

After the command is executed, in your `tailwindCSS` folder there is now a folder named `dist` . Inside it file called `output.css` , it is the result of Tailwind compiling the contents of `index.css` into `output.css`. The `output.css`  is used on your website.

### Start Using Tailwind in HTML

Now, in the index.html file, we add a `<link>` tag that points to the output file. That is, add the following instruction inside the `<head>`.

```shell
<link href="/dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Installation of Tailwind is now complete and you can use tailwind classes to style your website.
For example add `class="text-3xl font-bold underline"` to the `<h1>` in your HTML file and notice the changes.
